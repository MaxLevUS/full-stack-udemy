Principles of the Web design
1. Color Theory
2. Typography
3. User Interface design
4. User Experience design

-----------Color Theory--------------
Moods of the color power

Red - flame, love, energy, intensity (example - car, feeling energetic ro intensity of the car)

Yellow - sun, joy, intellect, attention (example - lady in Yellow on a beach, yellow always 
attracts attention, creating the logo or headline is good choice to have yellow)

Green - leaf, freshness, safety, growth (grocery companies)

Blue - water, stability, trust, serenity(to make the customers feeling trust you-payPal, CriptoComponies, banks, 
phsyhologies say that by wearing blue T-shirt for interview is much more trustble for interviewers rather that 
green or other colors.)

Purple - Royalty, Wealth, Femininity

Choosing the colors think what message should your color bring to the customers.

You may use 2 or 3 colors in your web site and combining those colors, you should approach from the 
scientific part of color theory. 
for example 
- to take 2 colors right to each other on the color wheel and this way is called Analogous color palette. So, this color pallet can be rally good for navigation bars and the body of your website, logo and background.
- if you really want your design to pop, you're better of taking two colors from opposite ends of the color wheel creating what's called Complementary Color palette or a Clashing palette. It really brings out each of the colors. (for instance in the supermarket meat is marked with the green paper to attract the attention to the meat, to pop up the meat a lot more and gives you this idea of freshness because of the green). But, what we shouldn't do with clashing colors or complementary colors is to try to style text and text background with it because it actually looks very jarring and you can feel your eyes sort of getting a little bit fuzzy. We need to use this combination in
cases when we wont things to stand our together. 
A good Idea to use Adobe Color or Colorhunt.co websites to choose the colors. 


----------------Typography---------------------------------------

Serif family where they have these little feet at the end of their central beams. And the reason why they have these old feet is because the serif typeface were inspired by the marble carvings of days of yore. it looks like historical font. This font making your design look more serious, more authoritative and also a little bit older as well. design for letterhead for a legal company or a magazine for architectural design. But, we can actually tell how old a type face would look by looking at the difference between the thickest and the thinnest parts of each 
letter.  So compare the Old Style 'o' versus the modern 'o'. The difference between the thickest part of the letter and the thinnest part gets more and more exaggerated as you get towards a more modern font. So, if you want something that looks authoritative but modern then maybe you want to go for a modern serif typeface like Didot. 
But, if you want it to come across as a little bit older, a little bit more aged maybe you have a winery, maybe you want to go for an Old Style serif instead. Now just sa different colors have different moods and emotions, different fonts also convey a different message to a user depending of which one you choose.
