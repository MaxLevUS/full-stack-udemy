SQL commands: SQL uses upper cases letters for the commands

- how to create the table: 
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name STRING, 
    price MONEY,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
) 
- below is another example of creating the table, where we have the FOREIGN KEY,
which links the tables together to establish the relationships:
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    order_number INT,
    customer_id INT,
    product_id INT,  -- Added product_id column
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id)  -- Now this will work
);

- show the table:
SELECT * FROM 'products'

- insert the value to the tables
INSERT INTO products
VALUES (1, 'Pen', 1.20)

- insert into specific product 
INSERT INTO products (id, name)
VALUES (2, 'Pencil')

- show specific tables
SELECT name, PRICE from 'products';

- show products by id
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1

- add another table
ALTER TABLE products
ADD stock INT

- add date to the table
UPDATE products
SET stock = 32
WHERE id=1

- delete options(if you do not indicate statement WHERE, that will delete)
DELETE FROM products
WHERE id=2

- joins the tables together
SELECT orders.order_number, products.name, products.price, products.stock
FROM orders
INNER JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.id

SELECT orders.order_number, products.name, products.price
FROM orders
INNER JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.id;
